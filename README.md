# BISEN source code

## Dependencies
To run BISEN, you will need to install libsodium-sgx, along with Intel SGX drivers and SDK.



## Compiling and running

First of all, generate and parse a text dataset, like Enron or Wikipedia. Also, specify the address of the storage/server module in SseIee.cpp:81.

To test BISEN, you need to start by generating an execution trace of your dataset, consisting of update and search operations. This trace is saved into a file, which is later fed to the IEE as operations are executed on it. Before compiling and running, check the search operations on _generate\_wiki.cpp_ or _generate\_enron.cpp_.

To compile the non-IEE modules execute:


```
# compile client, test and storage modules
mkdir build && cd build

cmake ..

make
```

To generate the trace file execute ```export DATASET_DIR="/path/to/the/dataset/files/" && ./Test```. The wiki dataset generator is prepared for the output files from the [WikiExtractor parse](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor/) (note: the generated files need to be all in the same folder and have the .txt extension). Smaller traces can be generated by passing ```-c <nr-articles>``` to the Test program.

To run the IEE:

```
cd src/tsgx && mkdir build && make && cd build

export DATASET_FILE="/path/to/the/generated/trace/file"

# check the server is already running in the address specified before
./test_bisen
```
